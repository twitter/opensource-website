# Contributing Guidelines

Looking to contribute something? Here's how you can help.

## Bugs reports

A bug is a _demonstrable problem_ that is caused by the code in the
repository. Good bug reports are extremely helpful - thank you!

Guidelines for bug reports:

1. **Use the GitHub issue search** &mdash; check if the issue has already been
   reported.

2. **Check if the issue has been fixed** &mdash; try to reproduce it using the
   latest `main` or development branch in the repository.

3. **Isolate the problem** &mdash; ideally create a reduced test
   case and a live example.

4. Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report. Include specific
   information about the environment - operating system and version, browser
   and version... and steps required to reproduce the issue.
