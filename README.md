Welcome to the Twitter Open Source Website repository! This is the source code for the [opensource.twitter.dev](https://opensource.twitter.dev) website, which showcases the open source projects developed by Twitter.

This site is built with [hugo], using a custom built-in theme.  Follow the
standard instructions on the hugo website to [install] and [run] hugo.  Just
make sure to use hugo-extended, which has added support for Sass/SCSS
stylesheets.

There are also some python scripts that run periodically to [update some repo
data].
