Twitter Open Source is a website that hosts open source projects developed by Twitter. The website is available at https://opensource.twitter.dev and is actively maintained.

## Technologies Used

The website is built using Hugo, a static site generator. It uses a custom built-in theme that is designed to match the Twitter brand. To run the website locally, follow the standard instructions provided on the Hugo website. Make sure to use the Hugo extended version, as it has added support for Sass/SCSS stylesheets.

## Repo Data Update

Periodically, some Python scripts run to update data related to the repositories hosted on Twitter Open Source. These scripts help keep the website up to date and provide the latest information to users
