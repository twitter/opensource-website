Stylesheets
===========

`_feather-*` files are part of the internal Feather framework used at Twitter.
They should not be edited directly, since they will be overwritten the next time
the components are upgraded.  Instead, any overrides that are needed should be
added to `_feather-custom.scss`.

Tweeps can get the latest feather resources at http://go/feathercode.
Specifically, we use:

 - http://go/featherraw/feather-core/dist/css/feather-core.css
 - http://go/featherraw/feather-component-button/dist/css/feather-component-button.css
